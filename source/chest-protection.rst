Chest Protection
================

WorldGuard provides rudimentary self-serve chest protection that a player may utilize by placing a sign underneath their chest with specially formatted text. We generally advise new setups to **not** use this chest protection as it is not an actively updated part of WorldGuard. In addition, :doc:`regions <regions/index>` are a preferred method of defining ownership because it does not have problems involving blocks like hoppers.
