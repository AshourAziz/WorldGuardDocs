Blacklist
=========

The blacklist allows you to control how blocks and items are interacted with by users. You can control what happens in the following events:

* When a player is about to destroy a block
* When a player is using an item to destroy a block
* When a player is placing a block
* When a player is using an item (lighter, bucket, etc.)
* When a player is interacting with an item (chests, pressure plates, etc.)
* When a player is dropping an item
* When a player is acquiring (or has acquired) an item
* When a player is eating something edible (cookie, apple, etc.)
