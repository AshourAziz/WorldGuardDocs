Installation
============

WorldGuard will only run if you have `Bukkit <http://dl.bukkit.org/>`_ or Bukkit-compatible server such as Cauldron, Glowstone, or Spigot. However, WorldGuard will not run on the plain Minecraft server that comes from Mojang.

.. note::
    Due to a `controversy and the following legal debacle <https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/2fkz55/as_one_of_the_original_contributors_to_bukkit>`_, you can no longer download Bukkit.

.. note::
    WorldGuard requires that you have `WorldEdit <http://www.enginehub.org/worldedit>`_ installed too.

1. If you downloaded WorldGuard as a ZIP file, extract it to find "WorldGuard.jar" inside. Otherwise, you should already have a .jar file.
2. In your server folder, create a "plugins" folder if one does not yet exist.
3. Copy the WorldGuard .jar file into the plugins folder.
4. Start your server.

Check your server log for errors. If you encounter errors, see the :doc:`troubleshooting <troubleshooting/index>` page.
