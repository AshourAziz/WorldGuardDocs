Regions
=======
 
WorldGuard lets you define named, 3-dimensional zones of various shapes called "regions." Each world can have zero or more regions defined, and each region may have owners, members, custom priorities, flags, and a parent region.

* Protect your spawn and other areas of your world
* Create a shopping district where players can own plots
* Prevent player versus player combat in neutral zones
* Deny entry into specific areas
* Setup hospital "heal" wards

A flexible system of parent-child hierarchy and priorities allows you to setup complex configurations.
